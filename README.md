# tape

Freewrite and flow write with the tape TUI

## Feature ideas

### Timer for doing fixed amount of time sessions

### Timed topics
After a certain number of seconds, a prompt appears to the right of the fixed center cursor.
The prompt can then be overwritten by the new typing. This infuses new ideas into the flow state.

### Select number of tapes on start up

### Persist tapes between sessions

### Tapes return to the beginning after fixed number of characters so you can review what you

### Decoration of the Deck
The tape are in a tape deck. Add some unicode to make it look like that.
